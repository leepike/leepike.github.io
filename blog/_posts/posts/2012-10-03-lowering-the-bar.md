I gave a talk ([video, slides, and paper](https://leepike.github.io/pub_pages/icfp2012.html)) at [ICFP](http://icfpconference.org/icfp2012/) last month, arguing that it can be easy to build a high-assurance compiler. I gave a similar talk as a keynote a couple weeks later at the very enjoyable [Midwest Verification Day](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/mvd12/), hosted by Kansas University this year (thanks [Andy Gill](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/csdl/fpg/Users/AndyGill) and [Perry Alexander](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~alex/) for inviting me!). This paper wraps up the [Copilot project](http://leepike.github.com/Copilot/). I had a great time (I mean, how often do formal methods engineers get to be around [NASA subscale jet aircraft](http://player.vimeo.com/video/15204969)?!?).
