In the January 2010 copy of _[IEEE Computer](http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/magazines/computer#3)_, [David Parnas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Parnas) published an article, "[Really Rethinking 'Formal Methods'](http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/magazines/computer#4)" (sorry, you'll need an IEEE subscription or purchase the article to access it), with the following abstract:

We must question the assumptions underlying the well-known current formal software development methods to see why they have not been widely adopted and what should be changed.

I found some of the opinions therein to be antiquated, so I wrote a [letter to the editor](http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/abs/html/mags/co/2010/03/mco2010030006.htm) (free content!), which appears in the [March 2010 edition](http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/abs/mags/co/2010/03/toc.htm).  IEEE also published a response from David Parnas, which you can also access at the letter link above.

I'll refrain from visiting this debate here, but please have a look at the letters, enjoy the controversy, and do not hesitate to leave a comment!
