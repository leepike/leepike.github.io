Science Friday had an [interesting podcast with Bruce Schneier](http://www.sciencefriday.com/segment/03/07/2014/delving-into-the-security-of-an-internet-of-things.html) worth a listen.  It discussed security in embedded systems (or as is hip to say now, _the Internet of Things_).  The idea of security in embedded systems seemed pretty obscure just a few years ago, so it's nice to see it being featured on a general-audience radio show.

So who's going to listen to it from their phone, connected to their car's audio over Bluetooth, on the way to the store to buy a Nest smoke alarm?
