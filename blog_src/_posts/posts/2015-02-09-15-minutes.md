Some of the work I lead at Galois was highlighted in the initial story on [60 Minutes last night](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/darpa-dan-kaufman-internet-security-60-minutes/), a spot interviewing Dan Kaufman at DARPA. I'm Galois' principal investigator for the HACMS program, focused on building more reliable software for automobiles and aircraft and other embedded systems. The piece provides a nice overview for the general public on why software security matters and what DARPA is doing about it; HACMS is one piece of that story.

I was busy getting married when filming was scheduled, but two of my colleagues (Dylan McNamee and Pat Hickey) appear in brief cameos in the segment (don't blink!). Good work, folks! I'm proud of my team and the work we've accomplished so far.

You can see more details about how we have been building better programming languages for embedded systems and using them to build unpiloted air vehicle software [here](http://smaccmpilot.org/).
