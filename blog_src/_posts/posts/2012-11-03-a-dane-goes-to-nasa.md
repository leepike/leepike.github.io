Last year, Nis Wegmann came from the University of Copenhagen to work with me on a NASA-sponsored project.  He was [recently interviewed](http://universitypost.dk/article/did-software-was-tested-nasa-planes) about his experiences.

Nis worked at the [National Institute of Aerospace](http://www.nianet.org/) in Virginia, just outside the [NASA Langley](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/home/index.html) gates.  Since [Galois](http://corp.galois.com/) is on the other side of the U.S., we mostly collaborated remotely.  (For a taste of what its like to intern at Galois itself, check out Ed Yang's [post](http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/08/day-in-the-life-of-a-galois-intern/).)  Nis is an outstanding programmer and great writer, so it made working together effortless, despite the distance.

Good luck in your future endeavors, Nis!
