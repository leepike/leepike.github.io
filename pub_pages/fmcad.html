<ul> <li>ABSTRACT:<br><br>
<em>Time-triggered systems</em> are distributed systems in which the nodes are
independently-clocked but maintain synchrony with one another.  Time-triggered
protocols depend on the synchrony assumption the underlying system provides, and the
protocols are often formally verified in an untimed or synchronous model based on
this assumption.  An untimed model is simpler than a real-time model, but it
abstracts away timing assumptions that must hold for the model to be valid.  In the
first part of this paper, we extend previous work by Rushby [Rus, 1999] to prove,
using mechanical theorem-proving, that for an arbitrary time-triggered protocol, its
real-time implementation satisfies its untimed specification.  The second part of
this paper shows how the combination of a bounded model-checker and a satisfiability
modulo theories (SMT) solver can be used to prove that the timing characteristics of a
hardware realization of a protocol satisfy the assumptions of the time-triggered
model.  The upshot is a formally-verified connection between the untimed
specification and the hardware realization of a time-triggered protocol with respect
to its timing parameters.
